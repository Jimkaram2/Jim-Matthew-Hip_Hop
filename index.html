      <h2>Artist Spotlight</h2>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQPzQKAwHxH6K0rdLCY9VrwF3Ww6g0tFK52TF8SsUrcR455AJPb" alt="N.W.A Group Photo">
      <p>Emerging from the streets of Compton, California, in 1987, N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes) comprised five groundbreaking artists: Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella. United by a shared vision, they broke away from party rap norms to amplify the voices of disenfranchised Black youth.</p>
      <p>Their debut album, <em>Straight Outta Compton</em> (1988), sold more than 3 million copies and ignited fierce debates on censorship. Tracks like “Express Yourself” showcased their musical versatility, while others, such as “Gangsta Gangsta,” wove gritty narratives of street life.</p>
      <p>N.W.A’s music was not only a raw reflection of systemic neglect—highlighting issues like police brutality and economic disparity—but also a cultural phenomenon that redefined hip-hop. Their unapologetic lyrics challenged listeners to confront uncomfortable truths and inspired subsequent generations of artists to use music as a tool for social commentary.</p>
      <p>Despite internal conflicts and eventual breakup, each member went on to shape music history: Dr. Dre as a legendary producer and entrepreneur, Ice Cube as a successful solo artist and actor, and Eazy-E as a key figure in establishing independent hip-hop labels.</p>

          <h3>Resistance & Protest</h3>

    <!-- Social & Cultural Connections -->
    <section id="connections" class="reveal">
      <h2>Social & Cultural Connections</h2>
      <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Los Angeles was rife with tension over police violence, economic disenfranchisement, and racial segregation. N.W.A’s firsthand accounts on tracks like “F**k tha Police” echoed the anger and frustration felt by Black communities nationwide.</p>
      <p>During the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, their music scored the background of civil unrest, becoming both a soundtrack and a catalyst for discussion on systemic oppression. The group’s graphic depiction of police misconduct led the FBI to send warnings to Ruthless Records—an unprecedented clash between artists and federal authorities.</p>
      <p>Beyond the U.S., N.W.A influenced a global movement: European and Asian hip-hop scenes adopted their themes of resistance and authenticity. Their legacy paved the way for conscious rap and socially engaged artists such as Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Public Enemy.</p>
      <p>Moreover, their entrepreneurial spirit—founding independent labels and controlling production—shifted power dynamics in the music industry, illustrating hip-hop’s role not just as artistic expression but also as a vehicle for economic empowerment.</p>

    <!-- Personal Reflection -->
    <section id="reflection" class="reveal">
      <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>Discovering N.W.A’s journey has reshaped how we view music as activism. Their courage in speaking truth to power reminds us that art can be a radical form of protest. In an era where social media amplifies voices, their model of bold storytelling feels more relevant than ever.</p>
      <p>As modern movements like Black Lives Matter harness digital platforms, we see direct parallels: raising awareness, mobilizing communities, and demanding accountability. N.W.A’s unapologetic narratives laid the groundwork for using creative mediums to challenge injustice.</p>
      <p>Exploring their discography taught us the importance of listening to marginalized perspectives—each lyric is a window into lived experiences that mainstream narratives often ignore. It’s a powerful reminder that culture and resistance are inseparable.</p>
